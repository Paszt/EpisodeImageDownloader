    "title": "Jason Lytle: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert",
    "description": "by ROBIN HILTON\n\nSometimes, it's hard to know what constitutes a band. Billy Corgan wrote and sang all the songs for The Smashing Pumkpins and still records under the name, even though the other original members are long gone. Same deal with James Mercer and The Shins. Jason Lytle, on the other hand, spent nearly 15 years leading Grandaddy, dissolved the group in 2006 and decided to continue as a solo artist, even though he wrote, sang and recorded Grandaddy's songs almost entirely on his own.\n\nYou've got to give the guy credit. Lytle could have slapped the higher-profile Grandaddy name on his beautiful, deeply moving 2009 album Yours Truly, The Commuter, and on his equally impressive record from this fall, Dept. of Disappearance, and few could have discerned the difference. But whatever. Lytle still makes some of the best music of his life.\n\nSo it's only fitting, and a rare treat, to see Jason Lytle go it alone in this Tiny Desk set, performing bare-essentials versions of songs he created and recorded at his home studio. He treated the NPR Music offices to two tracks from his current record, \"Willow Wand Willow Wand\" and \"Get Up and Go,\" as well as a super-cool (and tear-jerking) acoustic-guitar version of \"Jed the Humanoid,\" one of the most memorable songs he ever released as Grandaddy.",

    "title": "Passion Pit: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert",
    "description": "by STEPHEN THOMPSON\n\nPassion Pit's Michael Angelakos is a fussy sonic craftsman: A keyboardist and singer who started out working solo on his laptop, he now makes fizzily catchy electro-pop that orbits around monster hooks. He's not, in other words, the first musician you'd associate with a stripped-down performance behind NPR Music's Tiny Desk, where Technicolor production tends to give way to unfiltered voices and bare instrumental essentials. But Angelakos, a gifted songwriter who's been publicly forthcoming and articulate about his battles with bipolar disorder and substance abuse, is no intellectual or musical lightweight.\n\nAngelakos clearly saw an opportunity in bare-bones arrangements of his best-known songs — his 2008 breakthrough single \"Sleepyhead\" and two hits from this year's Gossamer, \"Take a Walk\" and \"Carried Away\" — that he couldn't explore with a full band. With only his own falsetto, an electric piano, and simple guitar lines from Passion Pit's Ian Hultquist, Angelakos gets to direct listeners toward his words, which blossom under scrutiny. \"Take a Walk,\" for example, turns up in a zillion commercials thanks to that monster hook, but it's also a rich, thoughtful sketch of an immigrant family's experiences, expectations, dreams and disappointments. In this performance, the hooks do persist, but words rule the day.\n\nSet List\n\"Take A Walk\"\n\"Sleepyhead\"\n\"Carried Away\"\n\nCredits\nProducer: Bob Boilen; Editor: Denise DeBelius; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Denise DeBelius, Christopher Parks; photo by Ryan Smith/NPR",

    "description": "by BOB BOILEN\n\nLord Huron is a band for just about anyone: The rich harmonies are welcoming, the lyrics relatable and the live performances thrilling. The group started out as a solo project for singer Ben Schneider, but is now a full assortment of terrific musicians, all based in Los Angeles.\n\nThe band's first album, Lonesome Dreams, just came out — you might have seen the Western-style film that accompanied the first single, \"Time to Run,\" which Scheider describes as, \"A tragic tale of the foolish things a man might find himself doing for a woman, and the consequences that foolishness may bring upon him and those around him.\"\n\nDig into this Tiny Desk Concert, and pay no mind to the fact that, like me, Schneider showed up in the office wearing a hat and bolo tie — and, like me, plays the same black Martin guitar.

    "description": "Bringing blues music to the Top 40 isn't easy: Only a handful of musicians have done it in the 30 years Robert Cray has spent winning awards, selling millions of records and otherwise kicking around on the national stage. But Cray has, crossing over from blues-club stages to arenas with the double-platinum 1986 album Strong Persuader and its single \"Smoking Gun,\" and has continued to stick around as one of the most reliably gifted and accessible guitarists around.\n\nFor all the attention Cray receives as an instrumentalist, it's his smooth, smoky voice that really sells his music. Equal parts soul man and blues belter, he presides over a crack band — bassist Richard Cousins, keyboardist Jim Pugh and drummer Tony Braunagel, who performs here by tapping a wooden box — at this Tiny Desk Concert in the NPR Music offices.\n\nLike any great blues singer, Cray makes heartache and other romantic dysfunction sound engaging and relatable: Ironically, if not surprisingly, his saddest song here (yes, sadder than \"Sadder Days\") is the one called \"I'm Done Crying.\" But all three of these tracks, culled from Cray's new album Nothin But Love, execute the deftest possible blend of emotional misery and instrumental majesty — just the way the blues ought to be.\n\nSet List\n\"Sadder Days\"\n\"(Won't Be) Coming Home\"\n\"I'm Done Cryin'\"\n\nCredits\nProducer: Bob Boilen; Editor: Denise DeBelius; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Denise DeBelius, Christopher Parks, Ryan Smith; photo by Lauren Rock/NPR",

    "title": "Dirty Three: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert",
    "description": "Every member of Dirty Three has a highly respectable career outside of the band: Violinist Warren Ellis works closely with Nick Cave, drummer Jim White is a sought-after collaborator with an instantly recognizable sound, and guitarist Mick Turner has released a string of gorgeous instrumental solo albums when he's not working as a visual artist. But when the three musicians share a stage as Dirty Three — as they've done on and off for 20 years now — the result can be both beautiful and bonkers, as the opening moments of this Tiny Desk Concert amply demonstrate.\n\nOne of the loudest performances ever captured in the NPR Music offices — and it's got some competition from any number of brass bands — Dirty Three's set alternately seethes and rages in a flurry of high kicks, shambolic rumbling, prolific hairiness and dramatic yelling. Standing atop Bob Boilen's desk, Ellis cuts a stooped, lanky figure, but there's real physicality to his performance here, as he leads Dirty Three through three stormy songs: \"Rain Song\" and \"The Pier\" (from this year's Toward the Low Sun) and \"Last Horse on the Sand\" (from 1998's Ocean Songs).\n\nSet List\n\"Rain Song\"\n\"The Pier\"\n\"Last Horse On The Sand\"\n\nCredits\nProducer: Stephen Thompson; Editor: Denise DeBelius; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Denise DeBelius, Christopher Parks, Ryan Smith; photo by Lauren Rock/NPR",

The group makes music I'd call \"new old-timey,\" but which its members call \"open-door gospel\" — gospel music that's not tied to any particular religious denomination.\n\nYou'll hear fiddle, banjo, guitar and washboard, all gathered around a single microphone in an old-style tradition. An unsigned band living in Brooklyn, Spirit Family Reunion makes music filled with joy, perfect for a Tiny Desk Concert. Its members told Weekend Edition Sunday's David Greene that they've been traveling the country in a beat-up Chevy conversion van, sleeping on floors and wherever else they can lay their heads. The band recently self-released a new album, No Separation, and its songs translate perfectly into foot-stomping singalongs in the NPR Music offices.\n\nSet List\n\"Leave Your Troubles At The Gate\"\n\"Green Rocky Road\"\n\"I'll Find A Way\"\n\nCredits\nProducer: Bob Boilen; Editor: Denise DeBelius; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Denise DeBelius, Emily Bogle, Lauren Rock; photo by Ryan Smith/NPR",

    "description": "There just aren't many bands like Antibalas. These are jazz players making dance music: Their music is big and fun, and their guiding spirit is Fela Kuti, the brilliant big-band leader and Nigerian Afrobeat pioneer. Afrobeat is a musical style featuring nearly endless songs, mixing funk and jazz, grooves and riffs, with the rhythm carried by not only the drums, but everyone. Everyone — horn players, bass players, guitarists — plays rhythm in Afrobeat music.\n\nAntibalas (Spanish for \"bulletproof\") is a Brooklyn ensemble, and 11 members turned up at the Tiny Desk. Many of these musicians may be familiar to listeners of Sharon Jones & The Dap Kings, The Roots, Paul Simon or Public Enemy. Most recently, Antibalas found some fame performing — and some of the members arranging and directing music — for the Tony-winning Broadway stage presentation of Fela!\n\nIt's one thing for a big group to make a big sound — and, sure, Antibalas does that — but what stands out is the subtlety of this ensemble; the way the horns weave in and out of each other, sometimes complementing and at other times inspiring and creating musical conversation between players. That extends to all the players, from vocals to guitar. When you start to listen to that conversation and you hear that build in a rhythm, it's so powerful, so full of joy. If they come to your town, drop what you're doing and go see them. Wear dancing shoes.\n\nSet List\n\"Dirty Money\"\n\"Him Belly Go No Sweet\"\n\nCredits\nProducer: Bob Boilen; Editor: Denise DeBelius; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Denise DeBelius, Christopher Parks, Lauren Rock; photo by Ryan Smith/NPR",

It's safe to say that we all share similar previewing procedures: At some point, we just sit and listen.\n\nWhat are we listening for? I can't speak for the others, but I'm constantly in search of music I haven't heard, but which sounds as if it's been in my life forever.\n\nThat's exactly what happened when I put on Yva Las Vegass' album, I was born in a place of sunshine and the smell of ripe mangoes. I was knocked out by the way she infuses Venezuelan folk traditions with a punk aesthetic. I heard songs as allegories, songs that told stories and songs that felt like deep primal screams, all accompanied by a traditional Venezuelan cuatro — a small stringed instrument similar to a ukulele.\n\nAt the NPR Music offices, Las Vegass weaves magic with her presence, her playing and especially her voice. You can't quite see her cut-off jeans and Chuck Taylor high-top sneakers behind Bob Boilen's desk, but in attitude and style, Yva Las Vegass is punk-rock through and through.\n\nSet List\n\"Mariposas\"\n\"Tonadas Y Cantos\"\n\"Polo Margaritenoio\"\n\nCredits\nProducer: Felix Contreras; Editor: Denise DeBelius; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Mito Habe-Evans, Ryan Smith; photo by Lauren Rock/NPR",

    "description": "We first met Kat Edmonson nearly four years ago, when All Songs Considered put out a challenge to songwriters on the eve of Barack Obama's inauguration. We asked musicians around the country to capture the moment in song, and Edmonson, a native of Texas, wrote and sent us \"Be the Change.\" It was clearly the best song we received, and she sang it with a unique voice and wonderful phrasing — so spot on. Later, we loved her cover of the George Gershwin-DuBose Heyward standard \"Summertime.\"\n\nHearing Edmonson makes it virtually impossible to do anything but stop and listen. It was clear, hearing the 29-year-old interpret \"Summertime,\" that the era around the 1930s and '40s was a rich place for her voice.\n\nThese days, Edmonson writes some of her own songs, digging deep into the spirit of those more artistically innocent times, and she finds contemporary writers who tell tales of longing and desire and more. On her new album Way Down Low, and now at the Tiny Desk, Edmonson is no longer simply inspired by days gone by; with that fragile voice, she's given it new life. In a digital and branded age, she stands out soft and clear.\n\nSet List\n\"Hopelessly Blue\"\n\"I Don't Know\"\n\"Lucky\"\n\nCredits\nProducer: Bob Boilen; Editor: Christopher Parks/Denise DeBelius; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Christopher Parks, Lauren Rock; photo by Ryan Smith/NPR",

    "title": "Avi Avital: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert",
    "description": "Other than bluegrass virtuosos like Ricky Skaggs, players of the mandolin don't often get taken very seriously. But a young Israeli musician named Avi Avital is trying to change that. He's not a bluegrass star; instead, his mandolin sings with the sounds of Johann Sebastian Bach, Ernest Bloch and contemporary composers like Avner Dorman.\n\nAvital's recording of a mandolin concerto by Dorman gave the instrument a little boost in 2010, when Avital became the first mandolinist to be nominated for a Grammy in the Best Instrumental Soloist category. The concerto was an Avital commission: The mandolinist feels strongly about challenging today's composers \"to consider the mandolin as a virtuoso instrument, and use its great sonorities and the immense palette of colors and expressions it can produce.\" You can hear a lot of those colorful sonorities in this Tiny Desk performance.\n\nAvital also adheres to the old \"necessity is the mother of invention\" axiom. Since mandolin compositions aren't thick on the ground, he arranges pieces written for other instruments — especially the violin, as the two instruments share the same tuning — and makes them his own.\n\nSuch is the case with Avital's opening piece, \"Nigun.\" Written by Ernest Bloch in 1923 for violin and piano, the music is a deep exploration, the composer says, of the Jewish soul. Avital's arrangement, like the original, pivots between the ecstatic and the introspective, rising in intensity (and pitch) until finally disappearing in a mist of quietly plucked notes.\n\nAvital caps off the performance with \"Bucimis,\" a raucous Bulgarian folk tune in the odd meter of 15/16. \"It's almost 4/4, but not quite,\" he says. \"I can play it, but I can't dance it.\"\n\nHow does one become a world-class, award-winning classical mandolinist? Avital says it all started as a kid, as he admired an older neighbor boy who took mandolin lessons. When the neighbor traded up to a newer, better instrument, \"somehow his old beginner's mandolin ended up in my hands.\" Good thing it did.\n\nSet List:\n\"Nigun\" (Ernest Bloch)\n\"Bucimis\" (Traditional Bulgarian Folk Tune)\n\nCredits:\nProducer: Tom Huizenga; Editor: Bob Boilen; Videographer: Michael Katzif; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; photo by Michael Katzif/NPR",

    "description": "Double bassist Renaud Garcia-Fons was destined to create music that spans genres and borders: He was born in France to a family with roots in the Catalonia region of Spain, and he's fluent in French, Spanish and English. Classical, jazz and flamenco represent equal parts of his musical DNA, and his technique reflects the delicate arco stylings of concert halls, the deep groove of jazz and the raw vitality of flamenco.\n\nThis appearance behind Bob Boilen's desk captures more than just Garcia-Fons' masterful technique. His musical vision can be heard in the digital loops of rhythm and sound that he generates entirely from his upright bass. He thumps, strums and pokes as he mines the sonic possibilities of not just his bass, but also his imagination.\n\nGarcia-Fons isn't always such a lone wolf; his collaborators include symphony orchestras, jazz groups and an amazing trio that practically defines the concept of world music. If you only knew him through one genre, you'd be surprised to discover these other sides to his skills.\n\nFor one fortunate group of NPR staffers, we had him all alone with just his bass and creativity.\n\nSet List\n\"Aqua Jan\"\n\"Hacía Compostela\"\n\"Rock Wandering\"\n\nCredits\nProducers: Van Williamson and Felix Contreras; Editor: Bob Boilen; Videographer: Michael Katzif; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; photo by Mike Katzif/NPR",

    "description": "We'd never tried to squeeze a piano behind the Tiny Desk, but when I saw a chance to have Rufus Wainwright play here, I wouldn't — and he probably wouldn't — have had it any other way. Somehow, we managed to fit a glossy black Yamaha upright against my full bookshelves. Then we tuned it and waited for some glorious moments.\n\nWainwright was touring behind his new album, Out of the Game, and had scheduled a more formal appearance at Wolf Trap in Virginia that evening. Here, sporting a T-shirt and shorts, he performed three songs. By the middle of his closer, \"Montauk,\" few dry eyes remained among the NPR employees and guests.\n\n\"Montauk\" is Wainwright at his best. The piano lines flow with forward motion in a Philip Glass way, and there's also a hauntingly beautiful story. Wainwright sings to his daughter Viva, whom he raises with his husband and whose biological mother is Lorca Cohen. Cohen is Leonard Cohen's daughter; Wainwright is the son of Kate McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright III. As if there weren't enough family ties already, the song imagines Viva grown up and visiting her two fathers in Montauk, a small community on the eastern tip of Long Island.\n\nWainwright plaintively sings:\n\nOne day you will come to Montauk\n\nAnd you will see your dad wearing a kimono\n\nAnd see your other dad pruning roses\n\nHope you won't turn around and go\n\n\"Montauk\" is the story of a modern family filled with old family worries, an emotional range familiar to the singer-songwriter.\n\nSet List:\n\"The Art Teacher\"\n\"Respectable Dive\"\n\"Montauk\"\n\nCredits:\nProducer and Editor: Bob Boilen; Videographers: Michael Katzif, Bob Boilen and Nick Michael; Audio Engineer: Neil Tevault; photo by Claire O'Neill/NPR",

    "title": "The Zombies: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert",
    "description": "Predicting music that will survive the ages just isn't possible. And the very existence of The Zombies in 2012 is even more baffling. Don't get me wrong; I love this group. A few of their 45 RPM singles — \"She's Not There\" and \"Tell Her No\" — I can still recall spinning 'round on my record player as a kid. But understand that this band didn't do so well at home in England and that its best known song, \"Time of the Season,\" came out after the band had already broken up. The fact that The Zombies were here at my desk, that the band put out a record of new songs — Breathe Out, Breathe In — that the full band just completed a U.S. tour and that they sounded fabulous (I saw them twice in the past six months) is beyond surreal, it's a marvel.\n\nThis stripped-down version of The Zombies features two founding members: Rod Argent, the very adept keyboard player and backing vocalist, and singer Colin Blunstone. It may be Blunstone's voice — that sultry, gentle, kicked-back style — that defined the band's sound. These days that voice packs more punch than it used to, which is odd and amazing for a 67-year-old singer, though it's still unmistakably him. We caught Blunstone early in the morning for this Tiny Desk Concert, a time of the day when his range was self-admittedly a bit strained. However, the essence is still all there and so is the chemistry between Colin and Rod, a chemistry that began 51 years ago.\n\nSet List\n\"She's Not There\"\n\"Any Other Way\"\n\"Time of the Season\"\n\"I Don't Believe In Miracles\"\nCredits\nProducer and editor: Bob Boilen; videographers: Bob Boilen and Nick Michael; audio engineer: Kevin Wait; photo by Ebony Bailey/NPR",

    "title": "Beth Orton: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert",
    "description": "English singer-songwriter Beth Orton is one of the best-known practitioners of a subgenre in which folk songs are set to electronic beats — it's a sound she employed to popular and powerful effect throughout the late '90s and early '00s, on hit albums such as Trailer Park, Central Reservation and Daybreaker. But these days, Orton has been increasingly willing to sweep aside digital accoutrements and just sit on a stool with an acoustic guitar, as this Tiny Desk Concert in the NPR Music offices makes plenty clear.\n\nPerforming well in advance of her new album's release — the Tucker Martine-produced Sugaring Season, her sixth full-length, comes out Oct. 2 — Orton was fairly new to most of these songs herself. She said she'd only played the new \"Dawn Chorus\" a handful of times publicly before unveiling it at the Tiny Desk, while \"Candles\" and \"Poison Tree\" won't penetrate the public consciousness until weeks if not months from now. But she made sure to close her warm, charming set on a comfortingly familiar note — appropriate for a singer who brought cupcakes to share with the crowd — as she dug out a spare, lovely rendition of 1999's \"Sweetest Decline,\" from Central Reservation.\n\nSet List:\n\"Candles\"\n\"Dawn Chorus\"\n\"Poison Tree\"\n\"Sweetest Decline\"\nCredits:\nProducer: Stephen Thompson; Editor and Videographer: Michael Katzif; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; photo by Emily Bogle/NPR",

    "description": "The Walkmen's wiry, weary, seething rock 'n' roll has mellowed in recent years, as vein-bulging hollers have given way to a richer, more gently paced and layered sound. But it's still not exactly the stuff of campfire crooning: We'd spent the days leading up to this Tiny Desk Concert in the NPR Music offices wondering how on earth The Walkmen would downsize these songs behind Bob Boilen's desk. For one thing, Hamilton Leithauser sings with such intensity that it'd be hard to dial down the instrumentation too much — you'd never hear it.\nLeithauser may wield an acoustic guitar in these three songs, but this is no awkward attempt to shoehorn booming rock anthems into meek arrangements that don't suit them. From the opening notes of \"Heaven,\" the magnificently stirring title track of The Walkmen's recent seventh album, it became clear that these guys were making the Tiny Desk accommodate their sound rather than the other way around. Leithauser's voice soared far down the hallways at various points in all three of these songs from Heaven — \"Remember, rememmmmmmmber, all we fight for!\" \"It's been soooooooooooooo long!\" \"Love is luuuuuuuuuuuuuck!\" — lending them grit and grace, not to mention hair-raising intensity that feels a little jarring coming from a bunch of guys in crisp button-up shirts.\n\nSet List:\n • \"Heaven\"\n • \"We Can't Be Beat\"\n • \"Love Is Luck\"\n\nCredits:\nProducer and Editor: Bob Boilen; Videographers: Becky Lettenberger, Nick Michael and Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; photo by Blake Lipthratt/NPR",
